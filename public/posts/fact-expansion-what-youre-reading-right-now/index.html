<p>In the realm of artificial intelligence and natural language processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for various applications. Two such techniques that harness the capabilities of LLMs are Fact Expansion and Fact Synthesis. In this blog post, we explore the concept of Fact Expansion, delve into its underlying technology, and discuss its potential implications for knowledge management systems.</p>
<h2 id="the-rise-of-fact-expansion">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/posts/fact-expansion-what-youre-reading-right-now/#the-rise-of-fact-expansion">The Rise of Fact Expansion</a>
</h2>
<p>Fact Expansion is a technique that leverages the strong capabilities of LLMs, such as summarization and imitation, to re-hydrate facts into longer, more descriptive writing. The core idea behind this method is that you provide a set of facts within a particular knowledge domain, and request the LLM expand these facts into a blog post, technical document, or any other form of extended text.</p>
<p>This technique can be beneficial if the expanded text is accurate and well-researched, as it allows for the creation of high-quality content without the need for extensive manual writing. However, there is also a risk that the LLM may start hallucinating details about the facts, which could lead to inaccurate or misleading information.</p>

</h2>
<p>One noteworthy application of Fact Expansion is FactWeave (<a href="https://github.com/patw/FactWeave)">https://github.com/patw/FactWeave)</a>, a blogging system that utilizes this technique to generate informative and engaging content. FactWeave serves as the underlying system for this very blog post, demonstrating how Fact Expansion can be employed to create valuable and reliable information for readers.</p>
<h2 id="the-opposite-technique-fact-synthesis">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/posts/fact-expansion-what-youre-reading-right-now/#the-opposite-technique-fact-synthesis">The Opposite Technique: Fact Synthesis</a>
</h2>
<p>While Fact Expansion focuses on expanding facts into comprehensive text, its counterpart, Fact Synthesis, aims to synthesize long-form texts into concise factual statements. Both of these techniques represent innovative ways of utilizing LLMs to automate knowledge management and communication processes.</p>

</h2>
<p>The combination of Fact Expansion and Fact Synthesis could pave the way for a new form of compressed communication that involves reducing lengthy texts into facts and subsequently uncoding them with Fact Expansion. This approach can be seen as analogous to the zip/unzip technique for file compression, but for knowledge instead.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Fact Expansion is an influential technique in the field of AI-powered knowledge management systems. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to expand facts into comprehensive text, this method has the potential to revolutionize how we create and share information. As researchers continue to develop and refine these techniques, we can expect to witness even more innovative applications of Fact Expansion in various industries and sectors.</p>

<h3 id="facts-used">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/posts/fact-expansion-what-youre-reading-right-now/#facts-used">Facts Used:</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Summarization and imitation are some of the stronger capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM)</li>
<li>Fact Expansion takes advantage of this by re-hydrating facts into longer, more descriptive writing</li>
<li>The core idea is you provide a set of facts in a particular knowledge domain, and request the LLM expand these facts into a blog post, or a technical document.</li>
<li>The LLM will fill in details and expand on the facts which can be good if the expanded text is correct or bad if it starts hallucinating details about the facts</li>
<li>FactWeave (<a href="https://github.com/patw/FactWeave">https://github.com/patw/FactWeave</a>) is a blogging system that takes advantage of Fact Expansion and is the underlying system that produced the content you are reading right now.</li>
<li>Fact Expansion is the opposing technique to Fact Synthesis, which we talked about in a previous post.  Both of these techniques are good examples of using LLMs to automate work.</li>
<li>These techniques could bring about a new form of compressed communication where we reduce long form text into facts and uncompress it later with Fact Expansion.  This could be seen as a type of zip/unzip technique but for knowledge, instead of files.</li>
<li>Conclusion:  Fact Expansion and Fact Synthesis are very powerful techniques for knowledge management and could represent a key element to future state knowledge management systems, powered by AI.</li>
